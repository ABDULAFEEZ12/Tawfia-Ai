Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) answered: 'Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him).' He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) replied, 'Yes, Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is with me.' He asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) said, 'Yes.' So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him), 'Who is he?' He replied, 'He is Adam (Peace Be Upon Him) and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left he weeps.' Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him)) said to its gatekeeper, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Abu Dhar (May Allah be pleased with him) added that the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) met Adam (Peace Be Upon Him), Idris (Peace Be Upon Him), Moses (Peace Be Upon Him), Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) and Abraham (Peace Be Upon Him), he (Abu Dhar (May Allah be pleased with him)) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him)) met Adam (Peace Be Upon Him) on the nearest heaven and Abraham (Peace Be Upon Him) on the sixth heaven. Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said, \"When Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) along with the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) passed by Idris (Peace Be Upon Him), the latter said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.' The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) replied, 'He is Idris (Peace Be Upon Him).\" The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) added, \"I passed by Moses (Peace Be Upon Him) and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.' I asked Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him), 'Who is he?' Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) replied, 'He is Moses (Peace Be Upon Him).' Then I passed by Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) and he said, 'Welcome! O pious brother and pious Prophet.' I asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) replied, 'He is Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him). Then I passed by Abraham (Peace Be Upon Him) and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him), 'Who is he?' Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) replied, 'He is Abraham (Peace Be Upon Him). The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) added, 'Then Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of the pens.\" Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said, \"Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Moses (Peace Be Upon Him) who asked me, 'What has Allah enjoined on your followers?' I replied, 'He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.' Moses (Peace Be Upon Him) said, 'Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to bear it.' (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to half. When I passed by Moses (Peace Be Upon Him) again and informed him about it, he said, 'Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be able to bear it.' So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses (Peace Be Upon Him) and he told me to go back once again. I replied, 'Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.' Then Gabriel (Peace Be Upon Him) took me till we reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundry) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk.\"",

She came running and the Prophet was still in prostration. She removed them and cursed the Quraish on their faces. When Allah's Apostle completed his prayer, he said, 'O Allah! Take revenge on Quraish.' He said so thrice and added, 'O Allah! take revenge on 'Amr bin Hisham, 'Utba bin Rabia, Shaiba bin Rabi'a, Al-Walid bin'Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, 'Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait and 'Umar a bin Al-Widal.'

I asked 'Ata' for further information, how the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) had kept his hand on his head as he was told by Ibn 'Abbas (May Allah Be Pleased With Him). 'Ata' separated his fingers slightly and put their tips on the side of the head, brought the fingers downwards approximating them till the thumb touched the lobe of the ear at the side of the temple and the beard on the face. He neither slowed nor hurried in this action but he acted like that. The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said: \"Hadn't I thought it hard for my followers I would have ordered them to pray at this time.\"",

(The sub-narrator is in doubt whether 'Abdur Rahman also said, 'My wife and our servant who was common for both my house and Abu Bakr's house). Abu Bakr (May Allah Be Pleased With Him) took his supper with the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) and remained there till the 'Isha' prayer was offered. Abu Bakr (May Allah Be Pleased With Him) went back and stayed with the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) till the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) took his meal and then Abu Bakr (May Allah Be Pleased With Him) returned to his house after a long portion of the night had passed. Abu Bakr's (May Allah Be Pleased With Him) wife said, 'What detained you from your guests (or guest)?' He said, 'Have you not served them yet?' She said, 'They refused to eat until you come. The food was served for them but they refused.' 'Abdur Rahman added, \"I went away and hid myself (being afraid of Abu Bakr) and in the meantime he (Abu Bakr) called me, 'O Ghunthar (a harsh word)!' and also called me bad names and abused me and then said (to his family), 'Eat. No welcome for you.' Then (the supper was served). Abu Bakr (May Allah Be Pleased With Him) took an oath that he would not eat that food. The narrator added: By Allah, whenever any one of us (myself and the guests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it increased from underneath. We all ate to our fill and the food was more than it was before its serving. Abu Bakr (May Allah Be Pleased With Him) looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving or even more than that. He addressed his wife (saying) 'O the sister of Bani Firas! What is this?' She said, 'O the pleasure of my eyes! The food is now three times more than it was before.' Abu Bakr (May Allah Be Pleased With Him) ate from it, and said, 'That (oath) was from Satan' meaning his oath (not to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it and then took the rest of it to the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him). So that meal was with the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him). There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) divided us into twelve (groups) (the Prophet's companions) each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the command of each (leader). So all of them (12 groups of men) ate of that meal.\"",

We were about to be put to trial for the pleasure of seeing Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) retreated to join the row as he thought that Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) would lead the prayer. Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) beckoned us to complete the prayer and he let the curtain fall. On the same day he died.\"",

They lodged many complaints against Sa'd (May Allah be pleased with him) and even they alleged that he did not pray properly. 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) sent for him and said, \"O Aba Ishaq! These people claim that you do not pray properly.\" Abu Ishaq said, \"By Allah, I used to pray with them a prayer similar to that of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) and I never reduced anything of it. I used to prolong the first two Rakat of 'Isha prayer and shorten the last two Rakat.\" 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said, \"O Aba Ishaq, this was what I thought about you.\" And then he sent one or more persons with him to Kufa so as to ask the people about him. So they went there and did not leave any mosque without asking about him. All the people praised him till they came to the mosque of the tribe of Bani 'Abs; one of the men called Usama bin Qatada with a surname of Aba Sa'da stood up and said, \"As you have put us under an oath; I am bound to tell you that Sa'd (May Allah be pleased with him) never went himself with the army and never distributed (the war booty) equally and never did justice in legal verdicts.\" (On hearing it) Sa'd (May Allah be pleased with him) said, \"I pray to Allah for three things: O Allah! If this slave of yours is a liar and got up for showing off, give him a long life, increase his poverty and put him to trials.\" (And so it happened). Later on when that person was asked how he was, he used to reply that he was an old man in trial as the result of Sa'd's curse. 'Abdul Malik, the sub narrator, said that he had seen him afterwards and his eyebrows were over-hanging his eyes owing to old age and he used to tease and assault the small girls in the way.",

He said, \"You will see Allah (your Lord) in the same way. On the Day of Resurrection, people will be gathered and He will order the people to follow what they used to worship. So some of them will follow the sun, some will follow the moon, and some will follow other deities; and only this nation (Muslims) will be left with its hypocrites. Allah will come to them and say, 'I am Your Lord.' They will say, 'We shall stay in this place till our Lord comes to us and when our Lord will come, we will recognize Him. Then Allah will come to them again and say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say, 'You are our Lord.' Allah will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid across Hell and I (Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him)) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers. Nobody except the Apostles will then be able to speak and they will be saying then, 'O Allah! Save us. O Allah Save us.' There will be hooks like the thorns of Sa'dan in Hell. Have you seen the thorns of Sa'dan?\" The people said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"These hooks will be like the thorns of Sa'dan but nobody except Allah knows their greatness in size and these will entangle the people according to their deeds; some of them will fall and stay in Hell forever; others will receive punishment (torn into small pieces) and will get out of Hell, till when Allah intends mercy on whomever He likes amongst the people of Hell, He will order the angels to take out of Hell those who worshipped none but Him alone. The angels will take them out by recognizing them from the traces of prostrations, for Allah has forbidden the (Hell) fire to eat away those traces. So they will come out of the Fire, it will eat away from the whole of the human body except the marks of the prostrations. At that time they will come out of the Fire as mere skeletons. The Water of Life will be poured on them and as a result they will grow like the seeds growing on the bank of flowing water. Then when Allah had finished from the Judgments amongst his creations, one man will be left between Hell and Paradise and he will be the last man from the people of Hell to enter paradise. He will be facing Hell, and will say, 'O Allah! Turn my face from the fire as its wind has dried me and its steam has burnt me.' Allah will ask him, \"Will you ask for anything more in case this favor is granted to you?' He will say, \"No by Your (Honor) Power!\" And he will give to his Lord (Allah) what he will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then turn his face from the Fire. When he will face Paradise and will see its charm, he will remain quiet as long as Allah will. He then will say, 'O my Lord! Let me go to the gate of Paradise.' Allah will ask him, 'Didn't you give pledges and make covenants (to the effect) that you would not ask for anything more than what you requested at first?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched, amongst Your creatures.' Allah will say, 'If this request is granted, will you then ask for anything else?' He will say, 'No! By Your Power! I shall not ask for anything else.' Then he will give to his Lord what He will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then let him go to the gate of Paradise. On reaching then and seeing its life, charm, and pleasure, he will remain quiet as long as Allah wills and then will say, 'O my Lord ! Let me enter Paradise.' Allah will say, May Allah be merciful unto you, O son of Adam! How treacherous you are! Haven't you made covenants and given pledges that you will not ask for anything more that what you have been given?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched amongst Your creatures.' So Allah will laugh and allow him to enter Paradise and will ask him to request as much as he likes. He will do so till all his desires have been fulfilled. Then Allah will say, 'Request more of such and such things.' Allah will remind him and when all his desires and wishes have been fulfilled, Allah will say \"All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides.\" Abu Said Al-Khudri said to Abu Huraira (May Allah be pleased with them), 'Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) said, \"Allah said, 'That is for you and ten times more like it.' \"Abu Huraira (May Allah be pleased with him) said, \"I do not remember from Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) except (his saying), 'All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides.\" Abu Sahd said, \"I heard him saying, 'That is for you and ten times more the like of it.\"",

Mahmud said that he had heard Itban bin Malik, who was present with Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) in the battle of Badr saying, \"I used to lead my people at Bani Salim in the prayer and there was a valley between me and those people. Whenever it rained, it used to be difficult for me to cross it to go to their mosque. So I went to Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) and said, 'I have weak eyesight and the valley between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it becomes difficult for me to cross it; I wish you would come to my house and pray at a place so that I could take that place as a praying place.' Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) said, 'I will do so.' So Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) and Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) came to my house in the (next) morning after the sun had risen high. Allah's Apostle asked my permission to let him in and I admitted him. He did not sit before saying, 'Where do you want us to offer the prayer in your house?' I pointed to the place where I wanted him to pray. So Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two Rakat, and finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim with him. I detained him for a meal called \"Khazir\" which I had prepared for him.--(\"Khazir\" is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat soup)-- When the neighbors got the news that Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) was in my house, they poured in until there were a great number of men in the house. One of them said, 'What is wrong with Malik, for I do not see him?' One of them replied, 'He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him).' On that Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) said, 'Don't say this. Haven't you seen that he said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah for Allah's sake only?' The man replied, 'Allah and His Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) know better; but by Allah, we never saw him but helping and talking with the hypocrites.' Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) replied, 'No doubt, whoever says. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and by that he wants the pleasures of Allah, then Allah will save him from Hell. Mahmud added, \"I told the above narration to some people, one of whom was Ab-u Aiyub, the companion of Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) in the battle in which he (Ab-u Aiyub) died and Yazid bin Mu'awiya was their leader in Roman Territory. Abu Aiyub denounced the narration and said, 'I doubt that Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) ever said what you have said.' I felt that too much, and I vowed to Allah that if I remained alive in that holy battle, I would (go to Medina and) ask Itban bin Malik if he was still living in the mosque of his people. So when he returned, I assumed Ihram for Hajj or 'Umra and then I proceeded on till I reached Medina. I went to Bani Salim and Itban bin Malik, who was by then an old blind man, was leading his people in the prayer. When he finished the prayer, I greeted him and introduced myself to him and then asked him about that narration. He told that narration again in the same manner as he had narrated it the first time.",

So will you lead the people in prayer?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"Yes, if you wish.\" Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) went forward and said Takbir for the people. In the meantime, Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) came crossing the rows (of the praying people) and stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) would never glance side-ways in his prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and (saw) Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him). Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) beckoned him to carry on the prayer. Abu Bakr raised his hands and thanked Allah, and retreated till he reached the (first) row. Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him) went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he completed the prayer he faced the people and said, \"O people! Why did you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever amongst you comes across something in the prayer should say, 'Subhan-Allah' for there is none who will not turn round on hearing him saying Subhan-Allah. O Ab-u Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned you to do so?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"How dare the son of Abu Quhafa lead the prayer in the presence of Allah's Apostle (Peace Be Upon Him)?\"",

The Prophet got up, and so did Sad bin 'Ubada, Muadh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka'b, Zaid bin Thabit, and some other men. The child was brought to Allah's Apostle while his breath was disturbed in his chest (the sub-narrator thinks that Usama added as if it was a leather water-skin). On that the eyes of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) started shedding tears. Sad said, \"O Allah's Apostle! What is this?\" He replied, \"It is mercy which Allah has lodged in the hearts of His slaves, and Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).\""

'Abdullah bin 'Umar said to 'Amr bin 'Uthman, \"Will you not prohibit crying as Allah's Apostle has said, 'The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives?'\" Ibn Abbas said, \"Umar used to say so.\" Then he added narrating, \"I accompanied Umar on a journey from Mecca till we reached Al-Baida. There he saw some travelers in the shade of a Samura (a kind of forest tree). He said (to me), 'Go and see who those travelers are.' So I went and saw that one of them was Suhaib. I told this to 'Umar, who then asked me to call him. So I went back to Suhaib and said to him, 'Depart and follow the chief of the faithful believers.' Later, when 'Umar was stabbed, Suhaib came in weeping and saying, 'O my brother, O my friend!' (On this 'Umar said to him, 'O Suhaib! Are you weeping for me while the Prophet said, \"The dead person is punished by some of the weeping of his relatives?\"') Ibn Abbas added, 'When 'Umar died, I told all this to Aisha and she said, 'May Allah be merciful to Umar. By Allah, Allah's Apostle did not say that a believer is punished by the weeping of his relatives. But he said, Allah increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives.' Aisha further added, 'The Quran is sufficient for you (to clear up this point) as Allah has stated: 'No burdened soul will bear another's burden.'\" (35.18). Ibn Abbas then said, \"Only Allah makes one laugh or cry.\" Ibn Umar did not say anything after that."

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) would say: \"Ma sha'a-llah\" (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, 'What Allah wished,' and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jaw-bone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the mean-time the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, 'What is this?' They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away. The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, 'Who is this?' They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, 'Who is this?' They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, 'What is this?' They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women, and children. Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), 'You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.' They said, 'Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection. The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of the Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gate-keeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.' I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, 'That is your place.' I said, 'Let me enter my place.' They said, 'You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.'",

'Umar said, 'I did not mean that, but I ask about that affliction which will spread like the waves of the sea.' I said, 'O chief of the believers! You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it.' He asked, 'Will the door be broken or opened?' I replied, 'No, it will be broken.' He said, 'Then, if it is broken, it will never be closed again?' I replied, 'Yes.'\" Then we were afraid to ask what that door was, so we asked Masruq to inquire, and he asked Hudhaifa regarding it.

Then I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and Ansar doing the same and it was not 'Umra alone. And the last person I saw doing the same was Ibn 'Umar, and he did not do another 'Umra after finishing the first. Now here is Ibn 'Umar present amongst the people! They neither ask him nor anyone of the previous ones. And all these people, on entering Mecca, would not start with anything unless they had performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba, and would not finish their Ihram. And no doubt, I saw my mother and my aunt, on entering Mecca doing nothing before performing Tawaf of the Ka'ba, and they would not finish their Ihram. And my mother informed me that she, her sister, Az-Zubair and such and such persons had assumed Ihram for 'Umra and after passing their hands over the Corner (the Black Stone) (i.e. finishing their Umra) they finished their Ihram.",

(the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka'ba or performs 'Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.\" 'Aisha said, \"O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, 'It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.' But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume the Ihram for worship ping an idol called \"Manat\" which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, \"O Allah's Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.\" So Allah revealed: 'Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.' \" Aisha added, \"Surely, Allah's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them.\" Later on I ('Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin 'Abdur-Rahman (of 'Aisha's narration) and he said, 'i have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom 'Aisha mentioned and who used to assume Ihram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka'ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka'ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' So Allah revealed: \"Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.\" Abu Bakr said, \"It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka'ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka'ba.",

Some of them brought the Hadi and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, \"Whoever among you has driven the Hadi, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka'ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka'ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka'ba, he offered a two Rakat prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. Those who took and drove the Hadi with them did the same as Allah's Apostle did.",
